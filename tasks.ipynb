The optimization of checking only up to the square root comes from ancient Greek mathematics, and the further optimization of checking only numbers of form 6k±1 is a more modern enhancement.\n",

    "- **Random number generation**: Square roots of primes produce high-quality pseudo-random sequences\n",

    "2. Removing the integer part to isolate the fractional component\n",

These \"nothing-up-my-sleeve\" numbers provide a cryptographic foundation that all network participants can independently verify without trusting any central authority. When Bitcoin's creator needed constants for the hash function, using mathematical derivations from irrational roots ensured transparency, as their values come from mathematics rather than arbitrary choice.

    "## Computational Complexity Analysis of Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bubble Sort Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Time Complexity\n",
    "- **Worst-case:** O(n²) - Occurs when the array is in reverse order\n",
    "- **Average-case:** O(n²) - Even with random data, we expect quadratic time\n",
    "- **Best-case:** O(n) - Occurs when the array is already sorted (with the early termination optimisation)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Space Complexity\n",
    "- O(1) - Bubble sort is an in-place algorithm that only requires a constant amount of additional memory regardless of input size\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Observations from the implementation\n",
    "The bubble sort implementation with different permutations of [1,2,3,4,5] demonstrates this complexity. The number of comparisons varies from 7 (for nearly sorted arrays) to 10 (for reverse or highly disordered arrays), showing how the algorithm's performance depends on the initial order of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Better Sorting Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Merge Sort\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) in all cases\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(n) - Requires additional memory proportional to the input size\n",
    "- **Advantages:** Stable, predictable performance regardless of input distribution\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:** Not in-place, requires extra memory\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quick Sort\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) average due to recursion stack\n",
    "- **Advantages:** Excellent performance in practice, can be implemented in-place\n",
    "- **Disadvantages:** Unstable, worst-case performance on already sorted arrays (can be mitigated)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Selection Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of sorting algorithm depends on several factors:\n",
    "- **Input size:** For small arrays (n < 10-20), simpler algorithms like insertion sort can outperform asymptotically better algorithms\n",
    "- **Nearly sorted data:** Insertion sort or bubble sort with early termination excel here\n",
    "- **Memory constraints:** Heap sort or in-place quicksort are preferable when memory is limited\n",
    "- **Stability requirement:** If maintaining relative order of equal elements matters, choose merge sort or insertion sort\n",
    "- **Guaranteed performance:** When worst-case performance matters, avoid quicksort and choose merge sort or heap sort\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "While the bubble sort implementation works for small datasets, it would be impractical for larger arrays due to its O(n²) complexity. In a production environment, most programming languages provide optimised sorting functions that typically implement adaptive strategies, often using hybrid algorithms like Timsort (Python, Java) that combine the strengths of different sorting approaches"

    "### Early Termination Optimisation\n",
    "I implemented the \"early termination\" optimisation in bubble sort using the `is_sorted` flag, which allows the algorithm to stop once a pass makes no swaps. This significantly improves performance for nearly-sorted arrays, changing the best-case time complexity from O(n²) to O(n)."
